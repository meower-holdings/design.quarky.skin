The Quarky Skin Store does not exist yet, and Quarky 2 has yet to exit pre-alpha. These guidelines are subject to change.

**Please do not attempt to make a Quarky skin just yet unless you want to waste your time.**

The Quarky Skin Guidelines are a set of rules and tips you'll want to keep in mind when making a Quarky skin for the Quarky Skin Store.

:::info Guidelines?! No fair! I wanna stay silly!

If you're making a private or unlisted skin, you don't need to follow most of these guidelines, so feel free to stay silly. But there are some exceptions, which might be enforced by the Skin Store server when possible, meaning you won't be able to work around them.

If you think you have an idea for a really cool **public** skin, but its main concept violates the guidelines, you can contact [qsg-exceptions@quarky.skin](mailto:qsg-exceptions@quarky.skin) for a case-by-case review. Since you are violating the guidelines, the idea could be rejected, but it's also possible that it gets approved or the Quarky Skin Guidelines are modified to allow such use cases. It doesn't hurt to ask!
